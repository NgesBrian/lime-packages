### Libre-Mesh packages "Big Bang" release (14.07)

This packages feed is meant to be used with an [OpenWrt buildroot][1], simply including a line like this in `feeds.conf`

```
src-git lime_packages git://github.com/libre-mesh/lime-packages.git
```

The easiest way to get a development/build environment set up properly, is by using our tool [lime-build][2],
specially if you don't have an openwrt buildroot already.
